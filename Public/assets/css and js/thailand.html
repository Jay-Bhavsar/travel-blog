<h1>Explore Thailand</h1>
<br><br>
<h5>I never really knew why Thailand, my home country, attracted so many tourists before until I started traveling in my own country as a tourist and my god is my country breathtakingly beautiful!
<br>
<br>
    With fresh eyes after being abroad for so long, I had come to appreciate the little things in Thailand like how great our food is, how diverse our cultures are, and how we are so incredibly friendly! To top it all off, traveling in Thailand is cheap as hell!
    <br>
    <br>
    Even though the pandemic had obliterated my income to almost nothing, I can still travel in Thailand quite comfortably without breaking the bank, and after a year of not being able to travel internationally, I now know why you guys love Thailand so much.
    <br>
    <br>
    And what better way to acknowledge the beauty of Thailand than to write a complete backpacking guide for you all. Here is a complete 10-days backpacking itinerary for Thailand including all the information you need to have an incredible trip here.
    <br>
    <br>
    Without further ado, let's take a look and where this itinerary will take you with a map:</h5>

    <h1>When to visit Thailand</h1>
    <br><br>
    <img src="thailand6.jpg" alt="">
    <h5>The best time to visit Thailand is from November to January where the weather is cooler and less humid due to Thai's northern climate making it much more enjoyable explore the beautiful outdoors of Thailand.
<br> <br>
        That said, Thailand in recent years has suffered a lot from air pollution due to the burning season and it is extremely prevalent during Thailand's winter period (December - January) so even though the weather is cooler, your visibility might not be the best. Be sure to buy a face mask if you decided to visit Thailand during this time.
        <br> <br>
        March - April is the hottest and humid period of the year so if you can't handle heat very well, avoid visiting during this time. The air quality may be a bit better during this time but it's not guaranteed.
        <br>  <br>
        All the other months are considered to be a rainy season which, even though the weather is a little more manageable than the summer months, you will also be seeing a lot more rain which might prevent you from enjoying the outdoors. Air quality during this time should be better due to rain.
<br> <br>
        As you can see, the best time to visit Thailand used to be during its wintertime BUT now that the air quality is getting worst and worst, you will have to decide which is more important to you as a traveler, good weather but bad air quality or vice versa.

        </h5>
        <h1>How To Get From Bangkok's Airports To Your Accommodation</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h5>
            By Bus: If you are staying near Khaosan Road or the Old Town area, I recommend you take the bus as it goes directly to your location without having to transit.
<br> <br>
If you fly into Suvarnabhumi International Airport, you can take the S1 bus and it will take you to Khaosan Road for 60 THB. Depending on the traffic, the journey should take around 1.5 hours, and the bus runs between 6 AM to 8 PM every 30 minutes.
<br> <br>
If you fly into Don Muang International Airport, you can take the A4 bus that should take you to Khaosan Road for 50 THB. From Don Muang Airport to Khaosan Road, you can expect around a 1-hour journey ahead of you. The A4 bus runs between 7 AM to 10 PM and it runs every 30 minutes.
<br> <br>
By Sky Trains: If you are staying elsewhere in Bangkok, you can take the sky train instead. Just make sure that you know which sky train station to get off at.
<br> <br>
If you fly into Suvarnabhumi International Airport, you can take the Airport Rail Link to Phaya Thai Station and from there, you will be able to connect to the main Sukhumvit Line and take the train to the nearest station near your accommodation.
<br> <br>
The Airport Link runs every 20 minutes and the trip from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Phaya Thai will cost you 45 THB and takes around one hour. From Phaya Thai, the price varies depending on how far your accommodation is. The sky train price starts at 15 THB. The train operates from 6 AM to 12 AM.
<br> <br>
If you fly into Don Muang International Airport, you will first have to take the A1 bus which will take you to Morchit BTS Station. The A1 bus comes every 5 minutes and it should cost you 30 THB.
<br> <br>
From Morchit BTS Station, you can then take the train to the BTS Station near your accommodation. The sky train price starts at 15 THB and goes up to 70~ THB depending on how far your journey is. The train operates from 6 AM to 12 AM.
<br> <br>
By Taxi: Taxi is a comfortable way to get to your accommodation but it can be pricey as there is an airport fee of 50 THB that will be added on top of the metered price so you can expect to pay around 300 THB if you are coming from Suvarnabhumi Airport or around 150+ THB from Don Muang Airport.
<br> <br>
One tip for taking taxis in Bangkok, if they don't turn on their meters, get out and get a new one. Do not tolerate this kind of behavior!

        <h1>How To Get Around Thailand</h1>
        <br><br>
        <img src="thailand7.jpg" alt="">
        <h5>By Air: This is the fastest way to get around Thailand and there are many low-cost airlines like AirAsia and Nok Air that operate many routes around Thailand that are extremely affordable. If you are in a rush, I recommend you fly.
<br> <br>
            To book a flight in Thailand, you can do so with the link here: Book a flight in Thailand.
            <br> <br>
            By Bus: This is one of the cheapest ways to get around Thailand, especially for long distances. The buses are cheap, quite safe, and surprisingly comfortable to travel in. It is recommended if you are not in a rush.
            <br> <br>
            If you are looking to reserve a seat for bus travels, you can book through here: Book a bus ticket in Thailand.
            <br><br>
            By Train: You can also take the train if you want a more scenic way of getting around Thailand. Keep in mind, that they are slow and often run late but traveling by train in Thailand is quite a fun experience and it is dirt cheap.

            <br><br>
            By Motorbike: This is only recommended for exploring the city and the surrounding areas, not for long distances. For long distances, take the bus or train instead. Rent a motorcycle only when you have already arrived in a city and would like to explore it further.
            <br><br>
            By Car: This is the most comfortable way to get around Thailand and you can rent it straight from the airports in Bangkok and elsewhere for around 700 - 1500 THB. To rent a car in Thailand, you can book through here:</h5>
