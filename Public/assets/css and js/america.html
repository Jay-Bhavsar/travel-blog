                <h3>Travel Experiences</h3>
                <h5>The team in place in India are excellent . Pickup at the airport was prompt . Yusuf is an excellent tour leader and very knowledgeable.

                    Hotels varied in standard which we were aware of before we traveled . The only hotel which we felt was not acceptable was the mandawa haveli. The bed linen was clean but the bathroom was dirty with a disgusting white plastic shower curtain black with mould . The white towels were grey with stains . Also we were worried about the standard of electrics , loose plugs and a vey old electric fan as the only heater .
                    
                    Apart from this one negative we felt the tour was excellent </h5>

                <h5> Satt genuinely loves his country and it shows, he doesn't shy away from the challenges but honestly introduces you to his vibrant country. He was unfailingly cheerful and helpful doing everything in his power to make sure that we had a wonderful trip. I was a bit ill at the end of the trip and he went out of his way to make me more comfortable and making sure that I had what I needed to feel better.

                    He is the best tour guide I have had, though Mustafa (OTG-Egypt 2011) was a close second, and I have toured with several different companies and their guides were good but Satt truly went above and beyond. I would travel with him again in a heartbeat!</h5>

                <h5>Fabulous Trip to India visiting top spots we'd always wanted to see.

                    We have just returned from a fabulous trip to Amritsar and the Gold Triangle. Our guide, Satendra, was very well-informed, funny and made sure everything ran smoothly.  </h5>
